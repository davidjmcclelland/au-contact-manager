 <!-- The require elements are how we "import" or "require" various resources into our view.
  It's the view equivalent of the ES 2015 "import" syntax. Just as JavaScript is modularized
  and requires importing of other resources, so do Aurelia views. In this specific case, we're
  indicating that we want to bring in our custom styles.-->
  <require from="./styles.css"></require>
  <require from="./contact-list"></require>

<!-- We have some HTML to setup a navbar at the top. Below that we have the application's main container div. This has two columns. The first will contain our contact list, indicated by the placeholder div. The second contains a router-view custom element.

  The router-view is provided by Aurelia and is a placeholder that indicated where the router should render the current route. This allows you to structure your application layout however you want, simply placing the router-view wherever you want to see the current page rendered. Whenever you have a configureRouter method, the view must also contain a router-view.-->

  <nav class="navbar navbar-light bg-light fixed-top" role="navigation">
    <a class="navbar-brand" href="#">
      <i class="fa fa-user"></i>
      <span>Contacts</span>
    </a>
  </nav>

  <div class="container">
    <div class="row">
      <!-- add the contact-list to where it belongs in the view DOM -->
      <contact-list class="col-md-4"></contact-list>
      <router-view class="col-md-8"></router-view>
    </div>
  </div>
</template>

<!--
There are two important additions. First, we've added another require element at the top, to import our new contact-list into this view. Remember that views are encapsulated, just like modules. So, this makes the contact-list visible from within this view. Second, we now use the custom element, right above our router-view.
