# au-contact-manager

The master branch contains the first part of setting up the contact manager - it builds but doesn't manage contacts yet.

Unlike the todo app, this project involves setting up a build environment geared toward a production style release. It uses Aurelia CLI, which replaces skeleton projects and other types of builds.
